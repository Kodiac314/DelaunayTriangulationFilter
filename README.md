Image stylization through triangulated blotching using by Delaunay Triangulation.

Points used to generate the mesh can be distributed via different modes by changing the MODE variable.

The 'uniform' MODE is recommended for most images, this will disperse points evenly throughout the image using an underlying grid,
but allows them to randomly be within a distance to allow for more natural shapes.
